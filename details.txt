Sampling(?) of data – Find out which columns are needed. How to handle missing data.
Cluster based on different attributes into ATTACK(Striker, Attacking Mid) & DEFENSE(GK, Defender, Defensive Mid)
OR
Cluster based on different attributes into Attacker, Midfielder, Defender, GK
Get team average across all regions
Find players in the team who are below the average( Ignore young players, based on number seasons played before the current one) .
Get ratio of goals conceded/ scored per team to determine where priority is necessary.
Find players in that area who can improve that area based on their rating (Use “potential”  field to give weightage to young players )








To do


<Team id , Team name, Season, Player id_1, Player id_2, … Player id_X,>
Build a team - players table per season 2013-16 (contains all the players for that season, also their skills)
Group players into categories (Attacker, Defensive midfielder, attacking midfielder, defender, goal keeper). Baseline method is to use TSNE (dimensionality reduction technique) on the player skills and cluster into groups. The main method is to build a decision tree which determines the player position/role based on their x-y coordinates.
Get average skill level of the team (consider only defensive players for defence attributes of the team, and so on), hence find the weak attributes.
